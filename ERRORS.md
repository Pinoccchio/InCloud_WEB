✅ **RESOLVED: Add Product Modal UI Improvements**

**Previous Issues**:
1. Redundant "frozen product" checkbox when category already indicates frozen status
2. Poor spacing around description field (too close to other elements) - Fixed ✅

**Issues Resolved**:
- **Removed Redundant Checkbox**: Eliminated "This is a frozen product" checkbox from UI

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Logical Flow**: Select "Frozen Meat" → frozen status automatically detected
- **Less Redundancy**: No need to check frozen box after selecting frozen category
