## Alert System Issues - RESOLVED ✅

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Export Button Removed** - Successfully removed the export button from alerts page as requested
2. **Bulk Operations Fixed** - Resolved "Failed to resolve selected alerts" error by adding required database constraint fields

### Root Cause:
The notifications table had foreign key constraints requiring `acknowledged_by` and `resolved_by` fields to reference valid admin IDs, but our functions weren't setting these fields.

### Changes Made:
- **AlertsTable.tsx**: Added `useAuth()` hook and updated all functions to include admin IDs
  - `acknowledgeAlert()`: Added `acknowledged_by: admin?.id`
  - `resolveAlert()`: Added `resolved_by: admin?.id`
  - `handleBulkAcknowledge()`: Added `acknowledged_by: admin?.id`
  - `handleBulkResolve()`: Added `resolved_by: admin?.id`

- **NotificationContext.tsx**: Updated context functions to include admin IDs
  - `acknowledge()`: Added `acknowledged_by: admin?.id`
  - `resolve()`: Added `resolved_by: admin?.id`

- **alerts/page.tsx**: Removed export button and related functionality

### Result:
✅ Alert status flow now works correctly: New → Read → Acknowledged → Resolved
✅ Bulk operations (select all + acknowledge/resolve) work without database errors
✅ Real-time subscriptions include all required fields to prevent console errors
✅ UI properly displays resolved status with purple badges and timestamps
✅ Export button successfully removed as requested

**Status: All issues resolved and tested successfully!**
